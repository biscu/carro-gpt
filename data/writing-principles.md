# Writing principles

Writing principles are general rules which apply to everyone who writes or will write texts for PostNord. These principles don't provide answers to detailed questions but should be seen as directional.

If we follow these principles, then the chances are greater we will be perceived as trustworthy, uncomplicated and friendly in our texts. These general principles are therefore guiding. In some cases, we will be able to check all the boxes. In others, only some of them. The important thing is that we understand and let the principles lead how we write, no matter who is writing.

## Understand

Treat people with respect. Put yourself in their shoes and communicate with them. Our primary focus is to solve peoples' needs.

## Clarify

Help people understand PostNord by using language that informs and encourages them. Make your information accessible; too much information may clutter the message.

## Respond with heart

Assume the positive about the situation, communicate with warmth, and see the solution rather than talking about the problem.

## Educate

Tell people what they need to know, not just what we want to say. Give them the exact information they need. People who read our information don't have access to everything you know.
