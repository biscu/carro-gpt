# Release notes

People read what's interesting and sometimes it's release notes. It's also a perfect way of telling our users about new features, new ways of interacting and address issues that our users have raised. Think of release notes as our dialog with users, probably our most loyal ones.

## How we write them

We want things to be uncomplicated, friendly and trustworthy. Just like sending parcels around the world. Our release notes should follow the same guidelines. Here are some key points we need to communicate:

## Communicating big changes or new features

- What has changed.
- Why it has changed.
- Benefits with the change.
- Do the user need to do something differently now.

## Communicating bug fixes or other issues

If it's a known issue, something our users have raised, then we should address that specific bug and let them know it's fixed. This shows that we listen to our community.

## How we structure release notes

### New
- New features
- New interactions, for example a new tab bar
- Major design improvements

### Improvements
