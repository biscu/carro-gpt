# Inclusive language

PostNord should be available for as many people as possible. If we're using a language that is clear, simple and takes other people's perspective in consideration, more people will feel welcome.

## Ground rules

1. Always strive for a high level of accessibility, using WCAG guidelines.
2. Clarity and simplicity are the easiest ways to include more people.
3. Don't ask for more personal information than needed.
4. Avoid wording that may be perceived as discriminatory.

## Vagueness

When we are unsure how to explain something, we tend to be to vague and use jargon. That makes our texts less trustworthy. This is especially tempting when addressing business customers. Remember, these are the same people who use our private services after the workday.

## Avoid own assumptions and judgements

Avoid making assumptions and judgements about the reader. This often occurs when talking about gender or age, or when we make assumptions about how people experience our product. Additionally, we should avoid writing about disabilities as an identity.
