# Numbers and currencies

## Date Formatting

**Use European date standard order for dates in lists and date pickers:** 2022-07-10

**For time spans:** 2022-07-10 to 2022-07-31

**Otherwise use this preferred and clearer way:** 10 July 2022

## Time Formatting

**Use colons and dashes (tankstreck) without spaces between times.**

## Phone Numbers

**I recommend using the following hyphenation when writing phone numbers:**

+46 73 394 91 42

## Units of Measure

**Leave a space between the number and the unit of measure, and use only lowercase letters.**

1,5 kg

## Currency Guidelines

### For Private Customers

**We use "kronor" or "kr" in contexts like buying flows, where there's no risk of confusion with other local currencies, such as in our digital services for private individuals. Always write it in lowercase across all languages.**

100,56 kr

### For Business Customers

**In digital services that support multiple currencies for the same customer, we use SEK, DKK, NOK, or EUR instead of "kr" or "kronor." This is often the case in our digital services for companies.**

100,56 SEK

### Swedish Currency Formatting

**Remember to use a comma (not a period) for Swedish öre.**

100,56 kr

### Large Numbers

**There should be a space between integers (1+) and thousands. Use lower cases in all languages for all currencies.**

10 000 euro
