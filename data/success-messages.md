# Success messages

Confirmations builds trust and confidence, and answers the question "what happened?". Success messages can be short and functional. They can also offer a valuable opportunity to express our brand personality and strengthen relationships with the user.

## After a smaller decision

Then the user add or edit something in a step or two this is often confirmed in a toaster that also signals the success by it's green color. Here we want to be as short and function as possible.

- Answer the question "what happend to what?"
- Passive tempus is okay.
- We don't need to use words as We, You or Your.
- Don't forget punctuation when it's a full sentence.

### Examples
`Receiver Kim Andersson was deleted.`

`The changes were saved.`

## After a bigger decision

After going through several steps to buy something or add a new service or product, it's not only important to tell the user what happened, but also provide comfort and guidance. Confirm that their decision was the right one!

- Confirm their decision and accomplishment.
- Explain what has been done.
- Guide the user where to go next with a CTA.
