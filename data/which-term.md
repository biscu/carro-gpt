# Which term should I use?

In some cases flow terms can be quite similar in meaning. Even if two alternatives can be technically right, consistency is essential.

## Submit or Send?

In English, you use Submit if there is something that you "send in," like a contact form. Send in English is more used for emails, SMS, etc. In Sweden we normally use the same word in both cases: Skicka

## Cancel or Close?

Use Close to close down a modal or window. Use Cancel if the ongoing operation will be canceled. The user selects Cancel to leave the flow.

## Edit or change?

Change can be used when you want to switch or transform an element, like changing a password or settings. Edit indicates that you can update, correct, or add to the existing content.

## Continue or next?

Continue indicates that the user needs to progress in the flow we are requiring, such as a purchase or when creating an account. Being an imperative, it emphasizes the need to move forward. Next is not as demanding in tone and could be used, for example, when navigating through pagination or when filling in personal information.

## Previous or back?

Use Previous together with Next and Continue together with Back in the same situations as mentioned above. Adding the verb Go to "Back" to make it an imperative aligns well with the use of Continue.

## Log in or sign in?

This is much debated, but the recommendation is to **use Log in** instead of Sign in. It's widely recognized and used. Additionally, in our source language, Swedish, we use Logga in, and the easiest way to translate that is Log in.

Note that it's the verb Log in we use, not the noun Login.
