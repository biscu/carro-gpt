# Error messages

Errors cause frustration, confusion and more work. So when they are needed, we present straightforward messages that let users know what happened and what they can do about it.

## Defining the error

The most detailed error message consists of three parts:

- What happened
- Why it happened
- How to fix it, or where to go

We aim to avoid vague error messages like "Something went wrong." If possible, provide clear reasons for the error. However, when multiple causes exist, we may need to be less specific. Our goal is to guide users to the next step, preventing them from getting stuck. Use links or buttons to help fix the error or direct them to a relevant page to start over.

## The anatomy of error messages

| Component | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **What happened** | Can't identify with BankID |
| **Why it happened** | The name in your BankID doesn't match the name of the recipient of this parcel. |
| **How to fix it** | You need to change the pickup location to a service point and pick up the parcel there with Photo ID. |
