# Buttons

## When to use buttons

A button is a widget that enables users to trigger **an action or event**, such as submitting a form, opening a dialog, cancelling an action, or performing a delete operation.

**Examples:**

`Edit details` 
`Add to cart →` 
`Clear all filters (2)` 

**Important for accessibility!**

- A user who asks a screen reader to read all buttons will assume that the buttons present a function.
- A button draws the attention. Consider cognitive load and avoid using too many on the same page.

## Words with similar meaning

In some cases flow terms can be quite similar in meaning. Even if two alternatives can be technically right, consistency is essential. Go to **Which term should I use** to read more.

## One or more word?

It's often helpful to use more then one word to make a button action clearer to the user. Like for example "Add to chart" or "Save changes". But It's not always necessary. This list shows some standards terms that often can stand alone, and still be easy to understand.

- Close (a window) – Stäng
- Save (something newly created) – Spara
- Cancel (what you do) – Avbryt
- Submit (a request or application) – Skicka
- Continue (in a longer flow) – Fortsätt
- Delete (what you see here) – Ta bort
- Download (this) – Ladda ner
- Undo (the last action) – Ångra
- Search (here) – Sök

## Ok is not Ok ..

Be careful with the usage of Ok as a button text. It can often be ambiguous and doesn't communicate what will happen if you press it. In case it's a popup with information it's often better informative with Close for example.

## Vague with yes or no

Yes or no on buttons is also vague. For example if you want to ask the user if he is sure of his action, use other words then yes or no, like:

Do you want to cancel the application?

`Cancel` 
`Keep`
