# Writing about the screen

To describe how to find or do something as a user, you need to refer to the user interface (UI). This guide explains how to do that.

## Use capitalization

When you're **referring to a specific term or name somewhere in the UI**, for example in a menu, capitalize the word as it appears there.

**Example:**
Select Account and go to Settings

## Don't use capitalization

If you're **making a general reference**, there's no need to capitalize.

**Example:**
See all the details for your account in your settings.

## No need to use bold or italic

Bold or italic text are not fully accessible. Additionally, bold text can create a cluttered and overwhelming experience, while italic text slows down reading.

## When to use quotation marks

Quotation marks are not necessary when guiding users through the UI. They are typically used for quotations, titles (such as book titles), to indicate irony, or to highlight specific expressions. For example: Don't use the term "UI" in customer communication.

## Words that find the way

### Go to

Use "go to" when you need to direct the customer away from their current workflow or location in the product. For example, when you need them to go to a specific page.

**Example:**
Go to Settings and select Account.

### Find

Find is a good alternative to Search when you want the customer to feel empowered. Locate can also be an alternative here.

**Example:**
Find the customer you want to send the invoice to.

### Select

When a user needs to choose one option from a list, like a dropdown or radio buttons. Select can also sometimes be combined with "From"

**Example:**
From the Edit menu, select Delete.
Go to the Buy Postage tab and select Send home

### Choose

Choosing an option, based on the customer's preference or desired outcome.

**Example:**
Choose your preferred language
Choose a payment method
