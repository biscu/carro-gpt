# Feature discovery

Feature discovery lets users discover new features or big design updates. This could for example be an onboarding for Portokoder or just letting people know about the introduction of Dark mode.

## Set the tone

There are two ways to go with feature discovery. Either a feature has moved and you have to inform the user or it's something completely new and you have to educate the user. In both cases **you have to communicate the benefits** and a call to action, if possible.

When something new as Dark Mode was introduced, we needed to **educate** the user in what it was and how to turn it on. It's straight to the point and clear.

## Do vs Don't Examples

### Do

#### English
**Dark mode is here**

Many of you requested the app in darker colours and the wait is now over. Turn dark mode on and off in "Appearance" on the "Profile" tab. Hope you enjoy it.

Letting someone else pick up your parcel is a feature in many steps, and it was important to **educate users in the benefits before explaining the process**. First understand what's in it for me and then how to achieve it.
